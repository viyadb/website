Samples
========

The following section contains several examples that cover most of the ViyaDB features.

## Running

It's recommended to use Docker image of ViyaDB for running the samples.
To launch Docker container with latest ViyaDB version, run:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --rm -ti -v /tmp/viyadb:/tmp/viyadb viyadb/viyadb:latest
```

## Mobile Attribution Tracking

Mobile attribution tracking is a powerful marketing tool that allows measuring productivity of users, advertisement campaigns, etc.
The biggest question that tools like this can answer is where has advertiser's money gone, and how to optimize future campaigns.

How does this work? Mobile application generates events upon user action, and delivers them to a server, where these events are
being joined to the attribution data received from an ad network and different partners. Finally, the data is analyzed based on
a date an application was installed. What we need to know for the sake of example is that we have events of the following types:

 * Click (clicking on an advertisement)
 * Impression (viewing an advertisement)
 * Install (installing an application)
 * In-App Event (custom in-app event generated by an application)
 * Launch (application was launched)
 * Uninstall (application was removed from a mobile phone)

In case of click and impression events, install date actually means click/impression date.

### Starting ViyaDB

Create `table.json` file containing:

```json
{
  "name": "activity",
  "dimensions": [
    {"name": "app_id", "cardinality": 20000},
    {"name": "install_date", "type": "time"},
    {"name": "install_country", "cardinality": 200},
    {"name": "install_currency", "cardinality": 200},
    {"name": "ad_network"},
    {
      "name": "campaign",
      "cardinality_guard": {
        "dimensions": ["app_id", "install_date", "ad_network"],
        "limit": 300
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "campaign_id",
      "cardinality_guard": {
        "dimensions": ["app_id", "install_date", "ad_network"],
        "limit": 300
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "site_id",
      "cardinality_guard": {
        "dimensions": ["app_id", "install_date", "ad_network"],
        "limit": 3000
      }
    },
    {"name": "adset"},
    {"name": "adset_id"},
    {"name": "adgroup"},
    {"name": "adgroup_id"},
    {"name": "event_country", "cardinality": 200},
    {"name": "event_currency", "cardinality": 200},
    {
      "name": "event_name",
      "cardinality_guard": {
        "dimensions": ["app_id", "install_date"],
        "limit": 300
      }
    }
  ],
  "metrics": [
    {"name": "install_cost", "type": "double_sum"},
    {"name": "install_cost_alt", "type": "double_sum"},
    {"name": "revenue", "type": "double_sum"},
    {"name": "revenue_alt", "type": "double_sum"},
    {"name": "clicks_count", "type": "int_sum"},
    {"name": "impressions_count", "type": "int_sum"},
    {"name": "installs_count", "type": "int_sum"},
    {"name": "launches_count", "type": "int_sum"},
    {"name": "inapps_count", "type": "int_sum"},
    {"name": "uninstalls_count", "type": "int_sum"}
  ]
}
```

Create the table by running:

```bash
curl -d @table.json http://localhost:5000/tables 
```

### Generating Sample Data

To generate 10M user activity events, run the following:

```bash
wget -q https://github.com/viyadb/viyadb-samples/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
viyadb-samples-master/activity/
./generate.py -d -n 10000 > /tmp/viyadb/data.tsv
```

This might take several minutes.

### Loading Data

Create load descriptor as follows:

```json
{
  "table": "activity",
  "format": "tsv",
  "type": "file",
  "file": "/tmp/viyadb/data.tsv"
}
```

Load the data by running:

```bash
curl -d @load.json http://localhost:5000/load
```

### Querying

The following query aggregates by install date, ad network and country (at the moment of application install),
and gives insights about revenue that mobile users brought during one month in USA and in Canada.
This helps understand what ad network was more effective in terms of payout by purchases in mobile app.

```json
{
  "type": "aggregate",
  "table": "activity",
  "select": [
    {"column": "install_date"},
    {"column": "ad_network"},
    {"column": "install_country"},
    {"column": "installs_count"},
    {"column": "revenue"}
  ],
  "filter": {"op": "and", "filters": [
    {"op": "eq", "column": "app_id", "value": "com.teslacoilsw.notifier"},
    {"op": "ge", "column": "install_date", "value": "2015-03-01"},
    {"op": "lt", "column": "install_date", "value": "2015-03-30"},
    {"op": "in", "column": "install_country", "values": ["US", "CA"]}
  ]}
}
```

Save the query in file `query.json`, and run:

```bash
curl -d @query.json http://localhost:5000/query
```
